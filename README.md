## Hi there üëã

I am Simon, a random dude from the Switzerland, mostly doing some java and kotlin stuff in my free time.
My past work experience includes working on some AR/MR stuff with Unity/C# and various Java/Kotlin projects for Comerge AG as a Junior Software Engineer.

To keep my repositories organized, I created GitHub organizations. They are split up into the following:
* [Wiki](https://github.com/simonpeier-wiki) a collection of useful cheatsheets, manuals and scripts
* [Tutorials](https://github.com/simonpeier-tutorials) tutorials that I have completed in self study
* [School projects BBW (Berufsbildungsschule Winterthur)](https://github.com/simonpeier-school-bbw) projects I have done for school during my apprenticeship

My own projects (which I do J4F üòÅ) can still be found in the ["Repositories"](https://github.com/simonpeier?tab=repositories) section on my personal profile!

If you'd like to collaborate with me, hit my dm's (via email to dev@simonpeier.ch)!
