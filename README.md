## Hi there, I'm Simon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a random dude from the Switzerland, mostly doing Java and Kotlin stuff in my free time.  
Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My past work experience includes working on some AR/MR stuff with Unity/C# and various Java/Kotlin projects for Comerge AG as a Junior Software Engineer.

My own projects are kept in the ["Repositories"](https://github.com/simonpeier?tab=repositories) section of my personal profile.  
Further projects can be found in my GitHub organizations, which I created to keep my projects organized. Most interesting are probably my [University projects](https://github.com/simonpeier-ost) and my personal [Wiki](https://github.com/simonpeier-wiki).
