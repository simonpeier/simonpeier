### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Simon, a random dude from the Switzerland, mostly doing some java and kotlin stuff in my free time.
My past work experience includes working on some AR/MR stuff with Unity/C# for Comerge AG as a Junior Software Engineer.

If you'd like to collaborate with me, hit my dm's (via email to dev@simonpeier.ch)!
